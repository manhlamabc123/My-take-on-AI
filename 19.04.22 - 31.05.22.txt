I had moved on to Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. Yes, I did not finish Machine Learning Basic Course, because of what my friend said. My friend told me that I already got the grip of the basic and it was time to move on. He recommended that I should start on Deep Learning Specialization course, so I did.
Till now, I had completed the first course in Deep Learning Specialization series, which is Neuron Network and Deep Learning. Already started on the second course, but have to be paused since I only got the financial aid of Course 1 recently. I finally can finish all the quizzes and programming assignments.
