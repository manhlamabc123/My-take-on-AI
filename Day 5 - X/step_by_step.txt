How to design a Program from Client's request (Text file. Ex: design.txt).

Step 1:
    Think about all the potential classes that I am going to have in my UML Class Diagram. And  the information that I need to track of in each class.

Example of Step 1:
    Potential classes:
        Game
        - ID: int
        - Name: char

        School:
        - ID: char
        - Name: char

        Member
        - ID: char
        - Name: char
        - Birthday: date
        - Email: char
        - Phone: char
        - isRegular(): boolean
        - Rank: int

        Enrol:
        - Member.ID
        - School.ID
        - Class: char

        Event
        - ID: char
        - Name: char
        - Game.ID
        - Start: date
        - End: date
        - Description: char

        Budget:
        - Value: int (+ or -)
        - Reason: char
        - Date: date
        
        PrintingList
        - ID: char
        - Member.ID
        - Deadline: date
        - Description: char
        - Price: float
        - Profit: float

        Product
        - ID: char
        - Name: char
        - Price: int
        - TradeFormat: char

        MatchingHistory
        - Member.ID1
        - Member.ID2
        - Game.ID
        - Event.ID
        - WinPlayer: int (1 or 2)
        - Win: int
        - Lose: int

        TradingHistory
