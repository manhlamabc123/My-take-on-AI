So if you look at the time and date of this report, it will not match with actual date of Day 4.
The reason for that it, I had a little bit of personal matter at the end of Day 4, I did not finish what I planned at the beginning of the day.
So today is suppose to be Day 5, but sorry to you and myself, that we are on slow schedule.
Except for a little bit miscalculation, everything is fine.
