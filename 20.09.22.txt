Yesterday (19/09/22), I received my Training Plan at my Intern Lab (RISE). My Training Plan is 4 week (1 month) to complete Coursera's Sequence Model Course (Deep Learning Specialization's Course), follow with 2 weeks of Neural Machine Translation Project, and finally 2 weeks of Neural Machine Translation for Automated Program Repair.
So I started yesterday, I already completed the first week of the course. Yes, I know that it is fast, and I might not fully understand everything. But that is how I learn, I will learning a bunch of new things, try to take it all in, and then do it again, review it. I do believe that this is the right method to learn, atleast this method suits me. So yeah...the first day went smoothly, nothing too hard to understand, maybe GRU and LSTM needs more attention, but we will see.
Today, week 2 of the Course, Word Embedding, everything start from simple to extreme very quickly. I will need to listen to this week lessons again, maybe read the related papers for it. For now, I will leave it at that, and move on. I will come back later.

So I did say that I will not learn anymore theory stuffs and focus on the pratical stuffs, but turn out I still need to learn about Sequence Model for my internship. So yeah...I will be updating more reports for now on.
