So today is the first day of Python Intermediate Level. And this will be the check list of what skill I need to learn.
x Comprehension
x Lambda
x Collections Module
x Map and Filter
x *args and **kwargs 
x Inheritance
x Advanced Class Behavior
x PIP
- Environments
- Module Creation
- Async IO

Mostly, I had seen them used in some tutorials, but I have yet practice them enough.
So tomorrow I will start doing some project and try to do my own project.
