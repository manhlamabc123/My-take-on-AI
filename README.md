# My-take-on-AI
My take on how to learn AI-ML
---------------------------------------------
This repo contains all of my processes on what I do in order to learn AI - Machine Learning - Deep Learning.

There are reports which I wrote for the purpose of keep tracking of what I did and the reason why I did it.
