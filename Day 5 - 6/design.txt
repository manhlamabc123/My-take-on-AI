Club's Member Management

This is a TCG Club, what we do here is playing 2 kind of TCG (Yu-Gi-Oh! and Cardfight! Vanguard) and 1 Pokemon (Pokemon Showdown). We also do event related to TCG.

So we need a web to manage our member, printing card for TCG, schedule event like Tournament or Offline/Online event. Can also be a small trading site.

As an admin, I need to know what my member is playing, how often do they play this game or that game, how much they contribute to our small community (this group). Manage this Club's money (Important!)

As a printer, I need to manage the incoming list of printing, price of each list, keep track of profit, keep track of deadline and when will the next list be printed.

As an member, I want to know my ranking, my match's history, my win and lose in official match (during event and tournament), upload my product for whoever want to buy or trade, and of course my personal profile.

Member has ID, Name, Birthday, Email, School, Class, Ranking.

Game (ID, Name), 3 TCG (Yu-Gi-Oh!, YGO! Master Duel and Cardfight! Vanguard) and 1 Pokemon Showdown. As an admin, I should be able to add Game, delete Game, do some adjustment.

We need to know what date will be the most fit for some event. We also have event for YGO only or Vanguard only, with that in mind, we need to count the member only play that game.
