So today, I spent most of my time to do some small, minor Python Project increase my Python skill.
What I learnt is not much, but it does help to recall what I learnt yesterday.

Is there any problem? No, not really

Tomorrow, I will try to learn about OOP in Python, again. Yes, this will be the second time.
So will again you ask? Because I forgot about it. So I have to learn it again.
Will there be different? Yes, I will learn the intermediate stuffs and the next day, I will do some Project right away.
